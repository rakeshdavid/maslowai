Dance is the most ephemeral art used in performance to convey a message to an audience. Music accompanies dance, creating more harmony and immersion, if the dance flows well with it.

Dance Review is the way to develop and refine the talent to deliver a smooth performance. It involves intuitive judgments and a systematic way to analyze dance. Through the review of champions in the dance industry, dancers get feedback on where they go wrong and on how to do better. This helps them to improve their skills and understand how to gain new skills and moves.
